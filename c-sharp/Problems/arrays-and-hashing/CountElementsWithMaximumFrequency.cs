 * 3005
 * Count Elements With Maximum Frequency
 **
 * You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.
 * Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such
 * that those elements all have the maximum frequency.
 *
 * The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
 *   Output: 4
 *   Explanation:
 *     The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
 *     So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
 *   Output: 5
 *   Explanation:
 *     All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
 *     So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= nums.length <= 100
 *   • 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Find frequencies of all elements of the array.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Find the elements that have the maximum frequencies and count their total occurrences.
