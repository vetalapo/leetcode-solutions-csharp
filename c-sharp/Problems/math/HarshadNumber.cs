 * Harshad Number
 **
 * An integer divisible by the sum of its digits is said to be a Harshad number.
 * You are given an integer x.
 *
 * Return the sum of the digits of x if x is a Harshad number,
 * otherwise, return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: x = 18
 *   Output: 9
 *   Explanation:
 *     The sum of digits of x is 9.
 *     18 is divisible by 9.
 *     So 18 is a Harshad number and
 *     the answer is 9.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: x = 23
 *   Output: -1
 *   Explanation:
 *     The sum of digits of x is 5.
 *     23 is not divisible by 5.
 *     So 23 is not a Harshad number and
 *     the answer is -1.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= x <= 100
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Use a while loop and divide x by 10 to find the sum of the digits of x.
