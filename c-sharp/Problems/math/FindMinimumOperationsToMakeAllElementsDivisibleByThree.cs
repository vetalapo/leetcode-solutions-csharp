 * Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three
 **
 * You are given an integer array nums.
 * In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from any element of nums.
 * Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums divisible by 3.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
 *   Output: 3
 *   Explanation:
 *     All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:
 *       • Subtract 1 from 1.
 *       • Add 1 to 2.
 *       • Subtract 1 from 4.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: nums = [3,6,9]
 *   Output: 0
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= nums.length <= 50
 *   • 1 <= nums[i] <= 50
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   If x % 3 != 0 we can always increment or decrement x such that we only need 1 operation.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Add min(nums[i] % 3, 3 - (num[i] % 3)) to the count of operations.
