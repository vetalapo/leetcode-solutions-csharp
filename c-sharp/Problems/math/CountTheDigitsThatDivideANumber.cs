 * Count the Digits That Divide a Number
 **
 * Given an integer num,
 * return the number of digits in num that divide num.
 *
 * An integer val divides nums if nums % val == 0.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: num = 7
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation: 7 divides itself, hence the answer is 1.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: num = 121
 *   Output: 2
 *   Explanation: 121 is divisible by 1, but not 2. Since 1 occurs twice as a digit, we return 2.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: num = 1248
 *   Output: 4
 *   Explanation: 1248 is divisible by all of its digits, hence the answer is 4.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= num <= 10^9
 *   • num does not contain 0 as one of its digits.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Use mod by 10 to retrieve the least significant digit of the number
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Divide the number by 10,
 *   then round it down so that
 *   the second least significant digit
 *   becomes the least significant digit of the number
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Use your language’s mod operator to see if a number is a divisor of another.
