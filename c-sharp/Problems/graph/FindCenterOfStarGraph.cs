 * Find Center of Star Graph
 **
 * There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n.
 * A star graph is a graph where there is one center node
 * and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.
 *
 * You are given a 2D integer array edges
 * where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that
 * there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi.
 *
 * Return the center of the given star graph.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
 *   Output: 2
 *   Explanation:
 *     As shown in the figure above,
 *     node 2 is connected to every other node,
 *     so 2 is the center.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
 *   Output: 1
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 3 <= n <= 10^5
 *   • edges.length == n - 1
 *   • edges[i].length == 2
 *   • 1 <= ui, vi <= n
 *   • ui != vi
 *   • The given edges represent a valid star graph.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   The center is the only node that has more than one edge.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   The center is also connected to all other nodes.
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Any two edges must have a common node, which is the center.
