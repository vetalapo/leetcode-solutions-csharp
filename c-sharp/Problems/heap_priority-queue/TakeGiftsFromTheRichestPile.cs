 * Take Gifts From the Richest Pile
 **
 * You are given an integer array gifts denoting the number of gifts in various piles.
 *
 * Every second, you do the following:
 *   • Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
 *   • If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
 *   • Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.
 *
 * Return the number of gifts remaining after k seconds.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4
 *   Output: 29
 *   Explanation:
 *     The gifts are taken in the following way:
 *       - In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.
 *       - Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
 *       - After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.
 *       - Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.
 *
 *     The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4
 *   Output: 4
 *   Explanation:
 *     In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile.
 *     That is, you can't take any pile with you.
 *     So, the total gifts remaining are 4.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= gifts.length <= 10^3
 *   • 1 <= gifts[i] <= 10^9
 *   • 1 <= k <= 10^3
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   How can you keep track of the largest gifts in the array
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   What is an efficient way to find the square root of a number?
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Can you keep adding up the values of the gifts while ensuring they are in a certain order?
 *
 * Hint 4:
 *   Can we use a priority queue or heap here?
